Hi, my name is **Milan Veselý**.

I'm currently studying Computer science at Charles University in Prague. :books:

BTW most of my repos are private right now… sorry \
But you can still look at my notes from MFF or a Gomoku perfunctorily written in Python (even though these are entirely in Czech, so not really)

*Hopefully, I will add more info later*
